## Week 1 Learning

During the first week, I focused on:

- JSX syntax and creating React components.
- Component composition and building reusable UI elements.
- Props and passing data to components, specifically to display data in a table component.
- **State and `setState`**: Understanding how to manage component state using `useState` and `setState` to add and update data in my todo application.
- **State Lifting**: Practicing lifting state up in the component tree to share state between components.
- **Lifecycle**: Learning about component lifecycle methods to understand component mounting, updating, and unmounting phases.
- **Event handling**: Implementing event handlers for user interactions, such as handling input changes in a search bar.
- **Conditional rendering**: Using conditional rendering to dynamically display different UI elements based on application state, like opening a modal for adding new tasks.
